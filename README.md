# MetaExport (git)

Allows you to export to a metadata + dated folder hierarchy.
For example:

    Destination: D:\photos
    Folder format: place/${city}/%Y/%m/%d/%1I%p
    will output to: D:\photos\place\Melbourne\2012\05\24\04AM\DSC_2239.jpg

(If the city metadata is blank, you can specify a default value [Default metadata] )

    Destination: S:\Somewhere
    Folder format: %Y/${rating} - ${artist}/%m
    will output to: S:\Somewhere\2012\3 - Lee\08\DSC_1527.jpg

Slicing of metadata values is supported (${metadataField:start:end}):

    Destination: S:\pics
    Folder format: %Y/${jobIdentifier} - ${fileName:1:4}
    will output to: S:\pics\2013\AppleJob - DSC_\DSC_1527.jpg

You can use negative indexing to specify "from the end of the value":
    Destination: S:\pics
    Folder format: %Y/${jobIdentifier} - ${fileName:4:-4}
    will output to: S:\pics\2013\AppleJob - 1527\DSC_1527.jpg
(Note in this case there will be a new folder for every shot because the slicing
includes parts of the string that are unique for every file.)

WARNING: THERE IS MINIMAL USER INPUT CHECKING.
         PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR INPUT.
( The exception to this is that colon will be converted to underscore, 
  since that is the only character I found that broke.)

 
Note the use of /, I have no idea if \ will work as a path separator but since / 
works on windows anyway, I would stick with that.

Time will be sourced from the dateTimeOriginal metadata and if not found will use
dateTimeDigitized.
You can select desired time source to use either the stored metadata for the time of
image taken or the time of export.
There are options for the handling of missing time metadata.

You can reset the "Do not show again" message prompt from the Lightroom Plug-in
Manager window.
